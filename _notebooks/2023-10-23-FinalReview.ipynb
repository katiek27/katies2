    "    <h1> would you believe the problems i faced. the ADVERSITIES? THE STRUGGLES?</h1>\n",
    "    <p> anyway i adapted improvised overcame like bear grylls the man the myth told me to. problmes we faced was mostly case sensitive things, like adding the wrong path to our png and also like misspelling half of the things we shouldve (ahaha initibattle and dracogon and capitalization) the lesson here is that it's great if we can have some friends along the way to help us out with our typos. MAYBE THE GAME WAS THE FRIENDS WE MADE ALONG THE WAY. i learned lots about classes and cooperatino and how annoying sophia can be sometimes but i have nochocie bc she admittedly did some of the code i guess. anynway next time i will strive to be a better coder. </p>\n",
