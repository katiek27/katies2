### PBL Unit 1 / Week 0
Learning outcome.  Installing Tools and showing usage of VSCode.
- Wednesday - We picked our partners and learned the very basics. This included terminal, github, and repositories.
- Thursday - We started free form images to share and get to know our partners. If our repositories worked, it was time to download tools.
- Friday - Tools took the vast majority of the time on Friday, we ran into some unexpected problems down the road.
