### Welcome to Week 3! ###
We have finally installed our snake game!!
Monday - Labor Day, but no rest for the wicked (compsci students). I grilled Chatgpt to help me figure out the appleDot function until it worked. Check <a href="https://katiek27.github.io/katies2//2023/09/01/hacksforsnake.html">"hacks"</a> for more information.

Tuesday - Getting around to updating our "time box" and meeting up with teammates.
