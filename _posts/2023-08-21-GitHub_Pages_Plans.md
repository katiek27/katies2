### Pair Planning Meeting
> Update Blog to contain all hacks.  Review week with Pair and look ahead and start plan for next week.  Try to be done and learn your machine before Monday EOD.
- A laptop, that you bring to class every day with ability to operate Development Tools on it or within the Cloud.
- GitHub Account, VSCode will be used to push/pull changes. GitHub is where we store and share code in the cloud, think of Google Docs but for Code.
- GitHub Pages will be used to host your personal blog: containing notes, answering hacks, and showing tangibles.  Building pages will teach Markdown, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and more.
- Jupyter Notebooks will be used in conjunction with GitHub Pages to build running Code in your blog.
- Slack Account, install the App on Laptop and/or phone, get used to reading announcements. Slack is the tool that we will use for messaging, we have been averaging 1000s of essages each year.
- VSCode is the code editor we will be using in this class.  VSCode is more than and editor, this type of tool is often called an Interactive Development Environment (IDE). 
- Run make commands to build and test blog locally, before pushing changes to GitHub pages.
