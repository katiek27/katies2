Mr. Mort introduced the SCRUM BOARD AGILE PLANNING! It was great. To demonstrate our ability to SCRUM, he told us to group up and work with another team to work on two calculators, one grade, and one not so grade. 

Thanks to Sophia and Aanya partnering up, we were able to work on our Grade Calculator. We learned about event listeners and adding maximum and minimum variables.
