## Progress
- The Snake Game is now readily avaiable to play in the "hacks" section of the notebook.
- Currently working on editing the code to make the apple emoji to appear instead. 
- Added borders and proper alignment and image editing to the blog. It appears more well-put together. 

## Aspirations
- strive on making it look nicer, it looks a little barren and empty.
- I'm not sure if we ever received proper instruction on adding these notebooks, it would've been nice to have.
