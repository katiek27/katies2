My homepage!

## <span style= "color: purple;">About Me!
I'm a sophomore, born and raised here in San Diego. I have two brothers, and a dog named Gomi, she's six years old and grumpy. In my free time, I crochet and listen to music, mostly pop and blues. I love to sleep! zz. I've been learning how to insert images, I want to change the theme and hopefully the color of my backgrounds. I'm using the internet to add images and links. My favorite color is **purple!** but I guess *blue* is good too.
